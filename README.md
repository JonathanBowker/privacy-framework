# Privacy Framework
The "Privacy Framework" is focused on gathering, presenting and linking data protection information from the relevant resources. The intention is to help data subjects, business partners and regulators to quickly find the information they need to inspect. It has been created and built ontop of the "Data Privacy Vocabluary" from the ground up from a data privacy point of view. Since its launch, the response from privacy legal teams has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any other resources, especially from fields outside of cybersecurity and law. Please let me know about anything that might be missing!
