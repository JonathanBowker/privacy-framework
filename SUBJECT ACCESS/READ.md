# SUBJECT ACCESS

The guidance below is for data subjects who wish to obtain access to their personal data; it will help you to understand your rights and make the most of your Subject Access Request.

## HOW CAN I MAKE A SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST

**Current staff:** If you are looking for a specific document, or a small amount of simple data (which does not contain personal data about other people in addition to yourself), you should contact the relevant team in the first instance to request this. In these instances, you should not expect to receive a formal written response to your request; the **[ORGANISATION]**’s primary aim is to facilitate access to your data, where appropriate.

**For all other individuals and staff who require more complex data:** (e.g. held by a number of staff or across several departments; or likely to contain personal data regarding other individuals, in addition to yourself), you are encouraged to use our Rights Request Form **[LINK TO RIGHTS REQUEST FORM]**, alternatively you can make your request by writing to the Privacy Team in Legal Services at: **[EMAIL]** or tel: **[TEL NUMBER]**.

You can make a subject access request verbally or in writing; although written requests are preferred (especially for larger volumes or complex data), so that we can be sure the request is clear and we can identify all the data you require. 

## DO I HAVE TO PAY A FEE

## DO I HAVE TO PROVIDE ANYTHING ELSE
**We may need to check your identity:** when we receive your request / prior to releasing the information:   ID verification checks will depend on you status and how you communicate/submit your request.  E.g., if your contact details don’t match those we hold on file for you, we will need further evidence of your identity, such as a copy of your passport/driving licence and a utility bill confirming your address.  You may therefore prefer to use your email address or a postal address that matches our records. 

If you attend in person to request or collect copies of personal data, be prepared to to show evidence of your identity. 

We may need to ask you for clarification, or for more information to help us identify your personal data:  **[ORGANISATION]** processes large amounts of data as we have a high number of **[DATA SUBJECT CATEGORIES]** and other contacts. If your request is broad or vague, we are entitled to ask you for more information to clarify your request to enable us to identify the data. 

If we ask you for clarification, the timescales for complying with your request will not commence until we receive this additional information from you.
