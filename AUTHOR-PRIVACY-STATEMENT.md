# AUTHOR PRIVACY STATEMENT

## Human readable summary
If you publish information on publicly available websites or social media platforms (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.), [ORGANISATION] may have collected Personal Data about you. This is because Logcially operates a service that collects publicly available information from the Internet, analyses it, puts it in a database, and offers access to its database, along with data analytics, to organisations who want to understand how Web Authors react to events and topics, and the spread of misinformation and disinformation online.

All the information we collect is already publicly available. The information is also information that you chose to publish online – we just collect it, index it, and put it all in the same place. This makes the data easier to search for what people are talking about and sharing online, and what they think of certain events, topics, brands and products.

We know how valuable your privacy is to you. You can trust us to handle it carefully. We work to keep your Personal Data secure, and we place restrictions on our customers’ use of the data they access through us.

Also remember: you are in control of your data. First, you have choices about what you post online, the platforms you use, and the privacy settings that apply to your posts. Second, you have legal rights depending on where you live and on our legal obligations. For example, you can ask us to show you what data we have about you, make us correct that data if it is inaccurate, and even ask us to delete or stop using the data.

This privacy statement addresses how we handle the personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) that [ORGANISATION] collects and processes about individual authors of online content (“Author”, “you” or “your”) through the Services that we offer to our customers.

## 1. For whom this statement is relevant
 This privacy statement applies to you if you publish information on publicly available websites (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit etc.) that we  collect data from.

## 2. Who is Logically
 For reference, we are [ORGANISATION], and we trade as [ORGANISATION] (“we”, “us” or “[ORGANISATION]”). Our registered office address is [ADDRESS]. Our registered company number is [REG NUMBER] and our VAT number is [VAT NUMBER]. Our subsidiaries, [SUBSIDIARIES] may also act as a data controller from time to time. We act as the data controller of the Personal Data that we process about you.

### 3. Why we collect Personal Data and from what sources
We collect and collate information that is publicly available on the Internet. If you can be identified from this information, and it relates to you, then it will be your Personal Data. For example, your name or username in connection with your Twitter or Facebook profile or the content of your public posts on these sites would be your Personal Data. More precisely, this is how we work:

1. We collect and index publicly available information from the Internet. 
2. We get data via search crawling or by contracting directly with content providers and data resellers to gain access to data from them. 

In each case, the only information that we have access to is information that Authors like you have published or made available publicly. This information is then collected, indexed, and stored in our database. We offer access to our database, as well as analytics of the data within that database, to customers (our “Services”). This allows our customers to learn more about how Web Authors react to events and topics of interest, and the spread of misinformation and disinformation online so they can act with more certainty in their strategic decisions.

## 4. What Personal Data we collect
#### Personal data you publish

While nearly all Personal Data we collect about you comes from publicly available sources, the  categories of  Personal Data we collect depends on the source of the data, what the source or platform chooses to make available to us, plus what you choose to make publicly available. The Personal Data that we collect could include the following categories and examples:

- Identification Information: your name, username, handle, or other identifier;
- Content Information: the content you have published via that name, username, handle, or other identifier, (e.g. comments, expressions, opinions, posts, etc.);
- Audio/Visual Information: your profile picture or other images or videos that you post or interact with;
- Employment Information: your job title or profession (including category of profession, for example “journalist”);
- Demographic Information: your interests and gender; and
- Geolocation Information: your location.

We may also analyse the Personal Data you have published to infer other Personal Data about you and provide our analysis to our customers. For example:

![alt text](https://github.com/JonathanBowker/privacy-framework/blob/main/images/Personal%20Data%20you%20have%20published.png "Personal data you publish")

When we infer data about you, we do so automatically, based on each individual post. We do not look at multiple posts in combination, and our algorithms analyse each of your posts individually.

## 5. How we use your Personal Data
### Primary use

We principally use each of the categories of your Personal Data referenced above to offer our Services to our customers. We do not use algorithms to make automated decisions about you in violation of applicable law or in a way that produces a significant legal effect. In other words, we only make data (inferred or not) and analytics available to our customers. Our legal basis for this type of data processing is that we have a legitimate interest in running our business and providing our Services to our customers. Whenever we process data that has sensitive Personal Data in it, we do so only because you have made that information public. In addition to our uses of your Personal Data, our customers also have a legitimate interest in accessing this data in order to understand their customer base and engagement with their brands.

We will keep your Personal Data for as long as it is necessary for us to provide the Services. However, if you request that we delete your data, please be aware that if your data is still published on the public sources we pull data from so you will need to remove it from there also.
