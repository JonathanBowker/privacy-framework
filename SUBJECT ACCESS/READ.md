# SUBJECT ACCESS

The guidance below is for data subjects who wish to obtain access to their personal data; it will help you to understand your rights and make the most of your Subject Access Request.

**Current staff:** If you are looking for a specific document, or a small amount of simple data (which does not contain personal data about other people in addition to yourself), you should contact the relevant team in the first instance to request this. In these instances, you should not expect to receive a formal written response to your request; the **[ORGANISATION]**â€™s primary aim is to facilitate access to your data, where appropriate.

**For all other individuals and staff who require more complex data:** (e.g. held by a number of staff or across several departments; or likely to contain personal data regarding other individuals, in addition to yourself), you are encouraged to use our Rights Request Form **[LINK TO RIGHTS REQUEST FORM]**, alternatively you can make your request by writing to the Privacy Team in Legal Services at: **[EMAIL]** or tel: **[TEL NUMBER]**.

You can make a subject access request verbally or in writing; although written requests are preferred (especially for larger volumes or complex data), so that we can be sure the request is clear and we can identify all the data you require.
